  About Zomato:
        Zomato is an Indian restaurant search and discovery service founded in 2008 by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah. It currently operates in 24 countries. It provides information and reviews of restaurants, including images of menus where the restaurant does not have its own website and also online delivery.

Data Context:
    The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurants at different places in Bengaluru. This Zomato data aims at analyzing demography of the location. Most importantly it will help new restaurants in deciding their theme, menus, cuisine, cost, etc for a particular location. It also aims at finding similarity between neighborhoods of Bengaluru on the basis of food.
